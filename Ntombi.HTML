  <h1>GirlCode Bootcamp Times</h1>
  <h6>Written by Ntombi Breakfast</h6>

  <h2>Breaking Barriers:</h2>
  <p>In a world where technology is shaping our future, the need for diverse voices in tech has never been greater.</p>

  <h2>What is GirlCode?</h2>
  <p>GirlCode was founded in 2014 as a women-only hackathon to address the inequality and gender gap in the tech space.</p>
  <p>GirlCode has evolved into an educational institution that engages women in tech, facilitates their skills advancement, and supports their entry into the tech industry.</p>
  <p>GirlCode is more than just a bootcamp; it is a community built to empower women and non-binary individuals through tech education.</p>

  <h2>My Bootcamp Experience:</h2>
  <p>The bootcamp has challenged me in every way possible. With little to no background in programming, I was nervous.</p>
  <p>But I happened to have the best facilitator, <i>Shantel Chamatumba</i>, who clearly articulates content and never leaves anyone behind.</p>

  <h2>Challenges I Faced:</h2>
  <p>Coming into bootcamp with <em>no programming background</em> was both exciting and intimidating.</p>
  <p>One major challenge is thinking like a developerâ€”when given activities, not knowing how to start without much help from source information.</p>
